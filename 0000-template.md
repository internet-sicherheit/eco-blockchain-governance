## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the guidline.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

## Specification

Provide guidance for implementers on an abstract and generic level.

## Examples & Best Practices

Provide guidance for implementers on a concrete level, prefaribly using real-world and realistic examples.
Strive to guarantee that:

- A possible implementation can be infered from given examples.
- Provide an usable example implementation as a proof of concept.
- Ideally provide an usable implementation as a 80/20 solution adhering to the pareto princicple.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

While you don't have to adress all points, they might be helpful to paint a complete picture. 

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
This can also reference existing implementations.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Is this topic solved in another Blockchain governance system?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this?
  If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other implementers and provide readers of your proposal with a
fuller picture. 
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if they are an adaptation from other communities.

Note that while precedent set by other communities is some motivation, it
does not on its own motivate an enhancement proposal here. 

## Unresolved questions

- What parts of the guideline do you expect to resolve through the enhancement proposal process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the guideline do you expect to resolve through an example implementation of this guideline before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this proposal that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this doc?
