## Summary

This RFC explains how a PR for a new RFC is processed and who is responsible for each working group, in order to make this process as transparent and effective as possible. 

## Motivation

Clearly defined rules make working on specific topics much easier. 
Through these rules, the work process is sufficiently described and no questions should remain open. 
In addition, the respective contact person for the topics is directly known and can be contacted directly if necessary.


## Process

We try to conduct reviews of the set PRs at fixed times during the day.
This way nobody is torn away from requested reviews during the actual work. 

Currently, there are the following review times:
  - The first thing in the morning
  - Right after lunch

The set PRs must be reviewed by at least 2 maintainers. 
One specific maintainer of the working group is mandatory, but a delegate must be appointed if he is unable to attend. 
If the PR is subsequently approved, it can be merged into master by one of the maintainers.

The merge is carried out by the maintainers of the working group using **Squash and merge** and editing the commit message accordingly.
When editing the commit message, please try to keep co-authors in the commit message, so GitHub can appropriately attach authors to the commit. 
If a maintainer is currently unable to attend to this task, a delegate will be appointed.
