## Summary

The RFC provides the guidelines to develop objective criteria for eligibility of members to join a consortial blockchain network.

## Motivation

Clearly defined criteria for eligibility of members will increase security, as well as transparency within the community and parties that can participate in the blockchain network.
Moreover, they can increase trust within the network, especially in the beginning, when a decentralized network is more prone to security risks since a malicious member can have a potentially higher impact.

## Specifications

* Organization forms which can join the consortium.
* The jurisdiction, the member has to be compliant with.
* Requirements for organizations/companies to join.
* Joining without meeting the requirements.
* special requirements for suspended and terminated members.

## Drawbacks 

* If the criteria are defined too narrow for a small pool of possible members, interested and interesting members may be excluded. 
Therefore the aimed size of the network and the potential members and users should be taken into consideration.

## Prior art

* The [Sovrin Business Policy V2 Policy](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Steward-Business-Policies-V2.pdf) and [Bloxberg Whitepaper v1.1](https://bloxberg.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bloxberg_whitepaper_1.1.pdf) has been used to retrieve possible answers within this document. 

## Unresolved questions

* When is an application considered complete for review?
* Change process for these criteria
