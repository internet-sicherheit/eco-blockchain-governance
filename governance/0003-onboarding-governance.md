## Summary

The RFC provides the guidelines to develop objective criteria for eligibility of members to join a consortial blockchain network.

## Motivation

Clearly defined criteria for eligibility of members will increase security, as well as transparency within the community and parties that can participate in the blockchain network.
Moreover, they can increase trust within the network, especially in the beginning, when a decentralized network is more prone to security risks since a malicious member can have a potentially higher impact.

## Specifications

* Which organization forms can join the consortium?
* Which jurisdiction does the member have to be compliant with?
* What are the requirements for organizations/companies to join?
* What may be further requirements?
* Can someone join who doesn't meet the requirements?

## Examples & Best Practices

Sovrin regulates membership requirements in its [Sovrin Business Policy V2 Policy](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Steward-Business-Policies-V2.pdf) as follows:

> ### Who can become a member?
> * an organisation registered to conduct business in at least one jurisdiction.
> * a governmental organization in a recognized jurisdiction.

> ### Which Jurisdiction does the member have to be compliant with?
> *The member must comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction it is legally licensed to operate or registered to conduct business.

> ### What are the requirements for organizations/companies to join?
> * A governmental body or agency, or an entity predominantly owned and controlled by the state, in a Jurisdiction as defined in the according Glossary.

> 2) includes in its application a written statement explaining why it supports the mission of the consortium and why it should be selected by the Board of Trustees as a Member
> 3) Agrees, contingent on its approval as a member to publish and maintain that written statement as a public document linkable on the Web.
> 4) Receives approval to be a Steward from the Sovrin Board of Trustee

> ### What may be further requirements?
> *The applicant has to provide evidence to the consortium in the application or requalification that the applicant is:
> * Financially solvent.
> * Not undergoing any criminal proceedings


## Drawbacks 

* If the criteria are defined too narrow for a small pool of possible members, interested and interesting members may be excluded. 
Therefore the aimed size of the network and the potential members and users should be taken into consideration.

## Prior art

* The [Sovrin Business Policy V2 Policy](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Steward-Business-Policies-V2.pdf) and [Bloxberg Whitepaper](https://bloxberg.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bloxberg_whitepaper_1.1.pdf)  has been used to retrieve possible answers within this document. 

## Unresolved questions

* When is a application considered complete for review?
* Who is in the Board of Trustees and how is it chosen/elected?
* Change process for these criteria
