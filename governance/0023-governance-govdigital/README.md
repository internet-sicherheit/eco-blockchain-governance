## Summary

The RFC describes the governance framework within govdigital, which contains rules of conduct for members and govdigital itself, as well as describing legal issues.

## Motivation

By describing the processes and regulations within govdigital, insights into practice can be ensured and a best practice can be described.

## Specification

* Forms of organization that can join the consortium.
* Jurisdiction with which the member must comply.
* Requirements for organizations/companies that can join the consortium.
* Regulations for fair collaboration in the organization.
* Ensuring monitoring of services within the organization
* Service level management

## Examples & Best Practices

Governance at govdigital is understood to be a framework for order and action, which contains rules of conduct for the members of govdigital and for govdigital itself and describes legal issues.

The admission criterion for membership of govdigital is that the member must be a legal person under public law or a body supported by it, or a private company in which only legal persons under public law participate. Members of govdigital are very important to the operation of the Blockchain infrastructure. They can act in the role of active or standby node operator.

Active node operators are members of govdigital and operate a node within a blockchain infrastructure for an application in their data center. They are remunerated according to the services they provide. Standby node operators are potential active node operators, members of govdigital and are interested in becoming active operators of a node. They can prove that they can meet the basic requirements for providing a block chain node. Standby operators are not part of a productive block chain infrastructure but are waiting for an internal competition procedure of govdigital to apply as an active operator.

In order to guarantee a fair cooperation and a fair distribution of orders between active and standby operators, some regulations apply within the cooperative:

1. Variable number of active node operators per application 
2. Order distribution through internal competition
3. Time limit of the performance period
4. Natural right to an active node operator role
5. Withdrawal from active node operator role before expiry of the performance period

### 1. Variable number of active node operators per application 
The number of active node operators varies per use case. govdigital examines per use case with which number of node operators an optimal cost structure can be guaranteed, so that the costs of the active node operators for the provision and operation of the infrastructure are (at least. covered. The number of active node operators can be flexibly adjusted over time by govdigital.

### 2. Order distribution through internal competition
In order to ensure a fair distribution of orders between all node operators, an internal competition among interested members of govdigital takes place for each application. Active and standby (potential) operators can "apply" for an active operator role. The selection of active operators is decided by govdigital. Criteria for the selection can be, among other things, additional effort during the concept phase, know-how in the block chain technology necessary for the application or already available personnel and computing capacities. A preferred selection of those members as active operators takes place, who have proactively contributed to the development of an operational block chain infrastructure during the concept phase and are therefore among the "first movers". Members are also free to specialize their data centers in specific block chain technologies and to network with a small number of other data centers to ensure availability and geo-redundancy. These "competence networks" can apply jointly.

### 3. Time limit of the performance period
The selection of active node operators is limited to a certain period of time. At the end of the pre-defined period, a new internal competition procedure will be carried out so that standby node operators will again have the opportunity to apply and switch to the "active" role.

### 4. Natural right to an active node operator role
Standby node operators have the right to automatically change into the role of an active node operator if they want to bring a blockchain application into govdigital and run it on the blockchain infrastructure. They become active operators without having to participate in govdigital's internal competition process.

### 5. Withdrawal from active node operator role before expiry of the performance period 
Members who have been selected as active node operators within an internal competition procedure commit themselves to act as active node operators for a certain performance period. Should a member wish to relinquish the role of active node operator before the end of the performance period, the member must inform govdigital as soon as possible. This is followed by an internal competition procedure for the vacant role of active node operator among the remaining members. Withdrawal from the active node operator role is only possible once a substitute member can provide an operational node. What counts is the collaborative spirit of the cooperative.

### Service Level Agreements and Operational Level Agreements
Services which are defined in processes within and outside of govdigital have to be mapped within Service Level Agreements (SLA. and Operational Level Agreements (OLA.. The parameters how these services are delivered are part of the SLA's and OLA's (Operational Standards.. SLA's are concluded between govdigital and its customers and represent an individual agreement about the services provided by govdigital to its customers. OLA's are concluded between govdigital and the active node operators and represent an individual agreement on the services provided by the active node operators to govdigital.  Special cases as well as the regulations for a fair collaboration within govdigital must also be contractually formulated. A special case is for example when a former customer is no longer a customer. In this case it must be contractually clarified in advance what happens in this case and how long the data records must be kept for the customer application in this case. These and other questions are individually designed and examined from a legal point of view in service level management.

### Monitoring of services
In order to ensure compliance with the SLA's and OLA's as well as govdigital's reporting obligations, the services must be monitored by a "monitoring body" of the cooperative. This body is appointed to monitor the services provided and can be an independent third party or an internal auditing and monitoring team. Ideally, and in order to avoid conflicts of interest between the parties involved, its employees should not have any other duties or interests in the cooperative or its members. In the case of govdigital, these tasks are performed by a Blockchain operations team. The operating team regularly checks whether the contractually agreed services have been provided by the active node operators. It is the cooperative idea of the cooperative that counts, so that openness and transparency of the node operators with regard to their services is required. In addition, regular audits take place in which the performance of the active node operators and possible improvement potentials are discussed.


## Drawbacks

If govdigital should not be mentioned as an example?

## Prior art

govdigital is currently the only initiative in Germany that brings together public IT service providers from the federal, state and local governments and offers the opportunity to break new ground in the further development of public services in a cooperative effort. 

## Unresolved questions

The framework described still needs to be implemented at govdigital.
