## Summary

Establishes the circumstances in which members of the network are suspended.  

## Motivation

In order to prevent abuse and encourage members to take responsability in the network, the governance includes the possibility of penalities, suspension and termination of members.  

## Specification

Members that do not comply with network governance terms MUST be suspended from the network.

Members whose organisations violated any legal terms or is in dispute with the network organisation MUST be suspended from the network.

Validator members that fail to achieve 98% availability over a period of 30 days MUST be suspended from the network.

Validator members that failed to take satisfactory measures after experiencing a security intrusion MUST be suspended from the network.

Members are inactive for a period of 3 months MUST be suspended from the network.

Suspended validator members that were running a node fail to requalify as validator network candidates in the following year.

Previously suspended members MUST provide additional guarantees depending on their case of suspension before qualifying as network candidates.

A suspended non-validator member that has not been reactivated within 180 days following its suspension MUST be terminated.

## Examples & Best Practices



## Drawbacks

Keeping members in the network may help in increasing the network size and popularity. 


## Prior art

Sovrin has well-defined governance policies for off-boarding in its Steward Business Policies, both for simple and validator members.

Bloxberg has a still relatively simple governance regarding off-boarding which applies for validator members.
