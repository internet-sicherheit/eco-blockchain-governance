### incentives economy at govdigital

A goal of the govdigital is it to create a sense-oriented instead of profit-oriented incentive structure for the members. Members of govdigital have the opportunity to actively 
participate within a collaborative community in the development and operation of a productive block chain infrastructure and to share and build up the corresponding know-how. 
They are part of the govdigital network, identify themselves with its goals and proudly represent them to the outside world. govdigital promotes the acquisition of new customers
for blockchain applications through active marketing and sales activities. The collaborative idea of the cooperative is in the foreground.

The govdigital creates the condition for a fair co-operation between the members by setting up and supervising regulations. For example, govdigital checks the optimal number 
of node operators for each use case, which ensures that the costs of providing the infrastructure are at least covered by all node operators. In addition, all members have the
chance to qualify as active node operators through internal competition procedures per use case. In addition, it is important to guarantee appropriate recognition to those 
members ("first movers") who have proactively participated in the development of an operational block chain infrastructure during the conception phase and who have invested
considerable resources. An equal distribution of the advantages over time should prevent a loss of motivation among the "first movers". For this reason, they are given a 
preferential position in internal competitive procedures for an active operator role.
